            <h2>Opacity</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="textmiddle">
                <p>Ever wondered how busy a certain place is? Ever drove 20 minutes to a restaurant
      only to find out it was extremely full? Well, no more! Welcome to Opacity.
      The app that will solve this overlooked problem for everyone. Opacity is a service
      where users update how busy the place they are currently at is. Other users can see when
      places have last been updated as well as what the last update status was. And it's
      all user and community based! When users update the capacity of a business, users will receive points.
      These points can be used to enter in various prize draws on the opacityapp website, if a certain
      point threshold is reached. More exciting features with the points to follow in the Phase 2 rollout.
      More information on the point system can be seen on the opacityapp.com website. Opacity aims to bring people together.
      It aims to create a community of users where everyone helps one another by constantly providing the capacity
      of the place people are currently at, in order to help other users make smart decisions on where to go.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Opacity's first tab, the popular tab, is the first thing users will see when they open the app.
       Choose from 9 preset popular categories and find businesses around you.
        These categories include Restaurants, Bars and Pubs, Desserts, Cinemas, Lounges and many more!
        Clicking on any category will find all the businesses around you and their associated current capacities!
        Be informed with your choice. Choose a place that fits your mood whether that be a local coffee shop that is empty
        or a bar full of people on a Friday night. Opacity has you covered.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                <p>Searching for any business is easy. Simply type what you would like to search in the search bar and voila.
  Opacity will find what you are looking for with the given radius you specified in Settings (by default this is 5 km).
  Opacity understands what you type! You can type a business name if you know where you wanna go such as Starbucks, or a search category such as a bar
  to find nearby bars. Opacity will display your results in both the map and the table. Instantly see when businesses have been last updated as well
  as what their capacity value was. Red is High. Yellow is Medium. Blue is Low. It's that simple! Tap on either the annotation or cell in the table view to
  go to Apple Maps and receive directions. Opacity automatically sorts your results by distance from closest to furthest from you within your specified radius!
  If you encounter a business whose capacity has never been updated you will see an N/A beside it. Be sure to visit it if possible and update to help grow the community
  and help other users be informed! Oh and if you update an N/A business you get 5 points, instead of 1!</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                <p>Set various filters in Settings to make your searches more efficient! Select whether you would like Opacity to only
      display businesses with a certain capacity level such as Low, Medium or High. Or if you would like to see all businesses regardless of which of the 3 capacities they have select the N/A filter.
      By default, the N/A filter is used so that users can see all businesses in their searches. In addition, be sure to specify the radius of your search to get the best results! Search radius goes from 1 to 20 km!
      Oh and those cool points - read on below to see how to collect them and what you can do with them!</p>

                <p>At Opacity its all about brining people together. Users update their current location at any business to help others know current capacity. When clicking on the Opacity tab you will be directed to a map that will automaticly find your current location. Opacity will also recognize if you are at a specific business and ask you to update its capacity. Users can also manually update their current location by holding down on any selected business if the user is found to be within 100m from the business. Updating any business would result in a gain of user points.<p>

                <div>
                <p>Points, points, points! Users recieve 1 point for every update they give,
                  and 5 points if it is the first time a given business is being updated. These points are used to enter in monthly draws!
                 On the 1st of every month we will post a monthly prize on the website! Each prize will have a certain points threshold!
                 If you meet that threshold you can enter in the prize through the website (click on the Prizes tab to learn about the Prizes)! At the end of the month
                 we will use a random number generator to select a random number and a lucky user will win the prize! We will contact the user to inform them and give them the prize!
                 There is a lot of plans for the points system, so keep collecting points and build the community! Exciting things hopefully to come!</p>
